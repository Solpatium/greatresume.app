I found a lot of them baiting you with the promise of 'free resume creator', but they allow you to export only to a text file (yes, a regular .txt file), forcing you to pay for the pdf. You learn this only after you fill ALL YOUR DATA. I think this process can be even more infuriating for people who are not tech savvy. Of course you can pay for resume creator, but for some people it is not an option."
